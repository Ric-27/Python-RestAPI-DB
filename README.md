# Python Databases

Implementation of 3 tables on SQLite:

- Movies
- Clients
- Rents

CRUD for Rents.

### Improvements:

- CRUD for movies and Clients
- Save more information about the movies (director, year, score) and clients (address, phone, year of subscription)
- Pack all the database related code in a package or class to avoid repeating code
- When presenting data, take into account empty responses from the db
- implement a simple swagger io API to connect to the CRUD and handle the db as a REST API
